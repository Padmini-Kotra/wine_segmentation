## Introduction
In this project, we explore a dataset containing various attributes of wines and aim to predict the customer segment (target variable) based on these attributes. The following machine learning models were applied:

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- Naive Bayes Classifier
Additionally, we employed Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to improve our predictions and assessed the models' performances.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains the following columns:

- Alcohol Percentage
- Malic Acid
- Ash
- Alkalinity
- Magnesium
- Phenols
- Flavanoids
- Nonflavanoid Phenols
- Proanthocyanins
- Color Intensity
- Hue
- OD280
- Proline
- Segment (Target Variable)
## Data Preprocessing
To prepare the data for modeling, we performed the following preprocessing steps:

- Data Cleaning
- Outlier Removal
-Handling Highly Correlated Columns
- Feature Scaling
- Machine Learning Models
We implemented the following machine learning models to predict wine quality:

- Logistic Regression: A basic classification model.
- Decision Tree Classifier: A decision tree-based model.
- Random Forest Classifier: An ensemble model for improved accuracy.
- Naive Bayes Classifier: A probabilistic classification model.
## Performance Evaluation
For each of the machine learning models, we evaluated their performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy.

## Linear Discriminant Analysis
To further enhance our predictions, we applied Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to reduce dimensionality and improve the separability of classes.

## Results
The results of our model evaluations and the impact of applying LDA can be found in the Jupyter Notebook provided in this repository.
